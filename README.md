## Project Title
*Provide a short and descriptive title for your project.*
Minesweeper  

## Project Description
*Write a short, concise project description of what your project aims to achieve. Include the motivation for this project (why do you want to work on it), the problem your project aims to solve, and the main goals that you want to accomplish within the rest of the semester. Also mention why you think the project might be useful or interesting to others. Keep this section short. A couple of paragraphs would do.*

My project aims to recreate the classic arcade game minesweeper. This will hopefully be a new take on a classic arcade game. The game, in its classic form, consists of randomly spread out bombs throughout a grid pattern. The player attempts to deduce logically where the mines are given knowledge of how many mines are in the 8 squares surrounding a given square. When the player is sure that there is no bomb on a certain square the player may click the square, if it wasn’t, they unlock new data, however,  if it was a bomb, they lose. 
I hope to capture the games classic charm and allure and add new game modes that will freshen the game up and create new interesting ways to play and enjoy, both alone and with friends. Minesweeper is such an amazing game that has lost favor in recent decades. However, hopefully with a new, competitive spin on the game people could grow to love it again. 

## Timeline

*To track progress on the project, we will use the following intermediate milestones for your overall project. Each milestone will be marked with a tag in the git repository, and we will check progress and provide feedback at key milestones.*

| Date               | Milestone                                                                                              | Deliverables                | Git tag    |

| **April&nbsp;12**  | Basic project structure with empty functions/classes (incomplete implementation), architecture diagram | Source code, comments, docs | milestone1 |
| **April&nbsp;19**  | Progress on implementation (define your own goals)                                                     | Source code, unit tests     | milestone2 |
| **April&nbsp;26**  | Completely (or partially) finished implementation                                                      | Source code, documentation  | milestone3 |
| **May&nbsp;10**    | Final touches (conclusion, documentation, testing, etc.)                                               | Conclusion (README.md)      | conclusion |

*The column Deliverables lists deliverable suggestions, but you can choose your own, depending on the type of your project.*

## Requirements, Features and User Stories
*List the key requirements or features of your project. For each feature, provide a user story or a simple scenario explaining how the feature will be used. You don't have to get this section right the first time. Your understanding of the problem and requirements will improve as you work on your project. It is okay (and desirable) to come back to this section and revise it as you learn more about the problem you are trying to solve. The first version of this section should reflect your understanding of your problem at the beginning of the project.*

*Also list any required hardware, software, on online services you will need. In specific cases, we might be able to lend you hardware or obtain online services. Please email the instructor for more details.*

I intend on making a competitive and timed game mode. This way players will be able to compete with their own high scores as well as compete with their friends and family. I’m also intending on creating a real time interactive game mode where two players input the coordinates of their mines and by getting tiles correct faster the map expands until they get to a certain number of tiles correct. I’d also like to play with sending the opponent more mines and making their game more difficult. 


## Technical Specification
*Detail the main algorithms, libraries, and technologies you plan to use. Explain your choice of technology and how it supports your project goals.*

I plan on using the Pygame library as well as many of the data structures we used in class. The Pygame library supports the visualization of games and works well with Minesweeper from my understanding. 

## System or Software Architecture Diagram
*Include a block-based diagram illustrating the architecture of your software or system. This should include major components, such as user interface elements, back-end services, and data storage, and show how they interact. Tools like Lucidchart, Draw.io, or even hand-drawn diagrams photographed and uploaded are acceptable. The purpose of the diagram is to help us understand the architecture of your solution. Diagram aesthetics do not matter and will not be graded.*

## Development Methodology
*Describe the methodology you'll use to organize and progress your work.*

I plan on using rigorous comments in my Python files to keep track of the work I am doing with a quick explanation of what each method and function does so that I can understand it at a glance. I will also try to use and become more familiar with Github as it is largely foreign to me but I would like to understand it better.

*First, describe your plan for developing your project. This might include how (or if) you plan to use*
- *GitHub projects board to track progress on tasks and milestones*
- *GitHub issues to keep track of issues or problems*
- *Separate Git branches and/or GitHub pull requests for development*
- *GitHub actions for automated testing or deployment pipelines*
- *GitHub wiki for documentation and notes*

*Please also describe how (if) you plan test and evaluate your project's functionality. Do you plan to test manually or automatically? Any specific testing frameworks or libraries you plan to use?*


I plan to test my project manually. I will apply rigorous testing on my own in addition to forcing any and every friend I have to use it as much as possible to find every bug. 

## Potential Challenges and Roadblocks
*Identify any potential challenges or roadblocks you anticipate facing during the development of your project. For each challenge, propose strategies or solutions you might use to overcome them, which may include getting help from the TAs/instructor. This could include technical hurdles or learning new technologies.*

I’m not very familiar with Github or the Pygame Library. I plan on reviewing the Pygame library documentation as well as various online forums to seek help as I need it. I am generally very good at finding the answers to problems I have online. Github is so widely used and so there is a wealth of information about it online. If I have any questions or issues, as a last resort I will go to the TAs or Professor Janak. 

## Additional Resources
*Include any additional resources, tutorials, or documentation that will be helpful for this project.*

I foresee utilizing many resources as I go along that will change as I go. I’m not entirely sure what I will use yet. If I have any issues I will be sure to communicate them with the TAs or Professor Janak immediately. 

## Conclusion and Future Work
*Wrap up your project description with any final thoughts, expectations, or goals not covered in the sections above. Also briefly discuss potential future work, i.e., what could be done next to improve the project.*


I foresee this project snowballing into an arcade type app in which I revamp many old arcade games and users would have the chance to pick and choose what antiquated game they’d like to play in a new, fun, social way.
