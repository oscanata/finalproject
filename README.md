## Project Title
*Provide a short and descriptive title for your project.*
Minesweeper 


## Project Description
My project aims to recreate the classic arcade game Minesweeper. The game consists of a grid of clickable tiles, with hidden mines hidden throughout the field. The player attempts to fill the board by using logic and information about neighboring mines to not click any of the mines. In recreating Minesweeper, I can create multiple game modes that are inovative. I will create a competitive mode where friends can race against each other. I will also create a custom gamemode in which you can design your own maps. I am to add a new fun twist to the classic video game and rejuvinate it with modern standards for online games. 

## Timeline

*To track progress on the project, we will use the following intermediate milestones for your overall project. Each milestone will be marked with a tag in the git repository, and we will check progress and provide feedback at key milestones.*

| Date               | Milestone                                                                                              | Deliverables                | Git tag    |

| **April&nbsp;12**  | Basic project structure with empty functions/classes (incomplete implementation), architecture diagram | Source code, comments, docs | milestone1 |
| **April&nbsp;19**  | Progress on implementation (define your own goals)                                                     | Source code, unit tests     | milestone2 |
| **April&nbsp;26**  | Completely (or partially) finished implementation                                                      | Source code, documentation  | milestone3 |
| **May&nbsp;10**    | Final touches (conclusion, documentation, testing, etc.)                                               | Conclusion (README.md)      | conclusion |

*The column Deliverables lists deliverable suggestions, but you can choose your own, depending on the type of your project.*

## Requirements, Features and User Stories
The Minesweeper game would require a timer, multiplayer functionality, customizable capabilities, varying difficulties, timed levels and more. 

The timer will be used to let users understand how well they preformed and keep rankings for each difficulty level.

The multiplayer functionality will allow players to make the game more interesting and social. 

The customizable capabilities will allow friends to make levels for each other, reveal love notes, create secrete messages and more. 

The varying difficulties will make sure that the game remains fun for all skill levels of players.

The timed levels allows someone to play competitively by themselves. It's a race against the clock.

## Technical Specification
*Detail the main algorithms, libraries, and technologies you plan to use. Explain your choice of technology and how it supports your project goals.*

I plan to use normal python programming through Anaconda and the pygame library to create the game. I plan on using numpy matrices to store the data. 

## System or Software Architecture Diagram

I don't think I can upload photos here. This is a link to the diagram:

## Development Methodology
*Describe the methodology you'll use to organize and progress your work.*

I plan on using Github project boards and git commits. I plan to test the product's functionality through extensive manual testing, by myself and with others playing.

## Potential Challenges and Roadblocks
I'm not familiar with the pygame library and will most likely encounter images with rendering the project visually. I plan on first turning to online resources and then contacting TAs.

## Additional Resources

I expect that various forums online will be great for finding useful information on these topics. 

## Conclusion and Future Work
I'm very excited about putting my own twist on the Minesweeper game. I would like to, in future iterations, create an entire arcade UI so that multiple games can be played in the same app
